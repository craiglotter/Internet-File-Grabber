Internet File Grabber
=====================

Internet File Grabber is used to parse HTML files, locating all valid HREF tags for download purposes. Based on the accept file types entered by the user, the application can then be used to download the selected files. This application is great for quickly ripping pages that contain links to a number of downloadable files.
